description: >
  The NxFit SDK for Flutter provides access to the NxFit REST API to retrieve user health data from the server. The SDK provides *clients*,
  which contain convenience methods to make HTTP calls to the NxFit API. Models for all the NxFit entities are also provided. To further
  assist in adoption of the SDK, *managers* and * repositories* are also provided that use caching. The NxFit SDK requires the consuming
  app to provide a user ID and an access token via the [AuthProvider] interface.
