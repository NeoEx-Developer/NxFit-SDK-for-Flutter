  /// Generates a URL to be used to be launched which puts the user through the integration authorize
  /// process. Part of the URL includes a redirect URL which is used to send the result of the authorize

  /// the authorize process. This is done to ensure that the application initiating the authorize process
  /// receives the result from the browser. An IntentFilter is required to make this work.
  ///
  /// ### Get the Application Package ID
  ///
  /// The application package ID may be retrieved via **Context.getPackageName()** and can
  /// be viewed in your app module's build.gradle file under: **android.defaultConfig.applicationId**.
  ///
  ///
  ///       android {
  ///           namespace 'com.example.app'
  ///           ....
  ///           defaultConfig {
  ///               applicationId "com.example.app"  // <-- this is the application package ID
  ///               minSdk 24
  ///               targetSdk 33
  ///               versionCode 1
  ///               versionName "1.0"
  ///               ....
  ///           }
  ///           ....
  ///       }
  ///
  /// ### Create the IntentFilter with the Application Package ID
  ///
  /// Define an **intent-filter** in the manifest to accept Intents with the scheme matching your
  /// application package ID. Example intent-filter:
  ///
  ///        <manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
  ///          <application .... >
  ///            <activity .... >
  ///              <intent-filter>
  ///                <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
  ///                <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
  ///                <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
  ///                <data android:scheme="com.example.app" />
  ///              </intent-filter>
  ///            </activity>
  ///          </application>
  ///        </manifest>
  ///
  /// ### Initiate authorize process
  ///
  /// To start the integration authorize process an Intent must be used to browse to the authorize page. The URI for
  /// the Intent is provided by [IntegrationsManager.connect], along with necessary redirect URI that includes the
  /// application package ID. With the integration authorize URI in hand, use the **CustomTabsIntent** to navigate
  /// to the provided URL. Example:
  ///
  ///     await _integrationsManager.connect(integrationIdentifier, (authUri) async {
  ///       launchUrl(authUri);
  ///     });
  ///
  /// ### Handle response
  ///
  /// When a user completes the authorize procedure, an Intent will be sent to the associated activity. This can be handled
  /// either in the Activity's **onCreate** method (via getIntent()), or in the **onNewIntent** method. One
  /// recommendation is to set the launchMode of the receiving activity in your manifest to "singleTop". This will prevent launching
  /// the activity a second time if it's already running. The Intent contains the response and it must be processed by the
  /// IntegrationsManager via the [IntegrationsManager.handleAuthorizeResponse] method. Example:
  ///
  ///     override fun onNewIntent(intent: Intent?) {
  ///       super.onNewIntent(intent)
  ///       val data = intent?.data
  ///
  ///        data?.let {
  ///          integrationsManager.handleAuthorizeResponse(data.toString())
  ///        }
  ///     }

  /// Will decode the connection result code and will emit a [ConnectionEvent] with the [IntegrationConnectionCode] for the integration.
  /// The emitted [IntegrationConnectionCode] is also returned to the caller.
  Future<IntegrationConnectionCode> handleAuthorizeResponse(String integrationIdentifier, String connectionResultCode);

  /// Disconnects the integration with the given [integrationIdentifier]. The current user will no longer have fitness data sent to the NxFit service from the integration.
  /// May cause an emission on the [disconnectionEvents] Stream.
